Memory management application is the project for the CS5600 course.

In this program, I assume that there are 10 pages available in the os_heap while memory space that can hold 20 pages in the disk. An array called record is used to store the information about the progress in the os_heap and disk. It also contains information on the latest time that uses the progress. 

Instruction to run the program:
In terminal, run make, page_alloc file will be created. Then run ./page_alloc, and the preset code will be run.
